# UMEWE

We all need simplicity in our lives. That’s where UMEWE comes in! Whether you’re looking to meet a friend, family member, or even a date, UMEWE will find the midway point between two different locations and display a list of 10 restaurants within that radius. You can even further define your search by typing in a specific parameter such as “sushi,” and even sort by cost, distance or popularity. 

After adding their inputs and clicking search, the user is presented with a map which displays the list of restaurants located halfway between the two locations. When the user selects one of the restaurant descriptions or “push pinned” map locations, they are shown a modal with a summary of the restaurant information. Hours, ratings and a price range are shown for a quick review. There is also a link to the respective restaurant on Zomato, which provides further detailed information including reviews, photos and a menu. 

It’s as simple as that. 

# Under the Hood

This website is run by HTML, CSS, Javascript. With the help of CSS framework, Bulma, UMEWE presents a polished and simple user interface.  It is responsive to any screen size and it is easy to use. Columns, tiles, dropdowns, input forms and modals are just a few of the framework’s components and elements integrated. Bulma does not include any JavaScript interaction, so we had to implement that ourselves.
